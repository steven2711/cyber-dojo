    question: "Is SEO illegal?",
    answer:
      "SEO is legal, but it's also important to understand that some tactics are frowned upon. In fact, there are currently many people working in the SEO industry who still have jobs because they know how to fly under the radar. Always ask questions about a company's SEO methodlogies before going into business.",

    question: "Why does it take so long?",
    answer:
      "Google has over 250 ranking factors to consider and has to crawl through millions of webpages each day. There are no gaurantees when Google will process any updates made to your website, but a good rule of thumb is about four weeks. Also, if you've never tracked your online efforts before, it takes time to collect data. The more data we have the better the results!",
