          <p>
            So what exactly is SEO? Search Engine Optimization is the act of
            optimizing your business&apos;s website to meet certain criteria
            which will help it rank in search engines like Google, Yahoo, and
            Bing.
          </p>
          <p>
            A search engine is a tool that lets people find information on the
            Internet. Search engines have to decide which websites are the most
            important ones. When people use search engines, they typically start
            by typing in one or two words to describe something they need or
            want. The more times your website shows up when someone searches for
            those one or two words, the better chances someone will visit your
            site.
          </p>
          <h2>why is seo important for my businesses?</h2>
          <p>
            The Internet Age has made the demand for search engine optimization
            experts more acute than ever. In fact, more customers are using
            search engines to find products and services than ever before, which
            makes optimizing your business locally a high priority.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2021 to date, Google accounted for just over 70% of all global
            desktop search traffic, followed by Baidu at 13%, Bing at 12%, and
            Yahoo at 2%. On the first page alone, the first five organic results
            account for 67.60% of all the clicks. These stats reveal that it
            pays to be listed on top.
          </p>
          <p>
            SEO is the most cost effective strategy way for businesses to
            acquire new customers.
