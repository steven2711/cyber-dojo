          <h2>what is seo?</h2>
          <p>
            So what exactly is SEO? Search Engine Optimization is the act of
            optimizing your business&apos;s website to meet certain criteria
            which will help it rank in search engines like Google, Yahoo, and
            Bing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Seems confusing? Don&apos;t worry, it&apos;s not as hard to
            understand as it sounds. Think of SEO as a way of getting found on
            the web. When people search for keywords related to your business,
            you want them to find your website. This is achieved by ranking
            higher than all the other results.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section className={styles.section}>
          <h2>why is seo important for my business?</h2>
          <p>
            More customers are using search engines to find products and
            services than ever before, which makes optimizing your business
            locally a high priority.
          </p>
          <StatBox
            text="In 2021 to date, Google accounted for just over 70% of all global
        desktop search traffic, followed by Baidu at 13%, Bing at 12%, and Yahoo
        at 2%. On the first page alone, the first five organic results account
        for 67.60% of all the clicks. These stats reveal that it pays to be
        listed on top!"
          />
          <p>
            This is why almost every local business needs to invest in good SEO
            practices to increase their visibility on the web. The more traffic
            you can get from search results, the higher your chances of having a
            successful business. By optimizing your site&apos;s SEO, you ensure
            that search engines have indexed and ranked your pages for relevant
            keywords that will help drive sales and leads.

            Unfortunate, but true. Be skeptical if anyone claims they can offer
            that as a gaurantee. It&apos;s not impossible. It just takes many
            years and constant SEO vigilance battling against competitors and
            search engine algorithms to get to the top.
