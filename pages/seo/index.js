          <h2>what is seo?</h2>
          <p>
            So what exactly is SEO? Search Engine Optimization is the act of
            optimizing your business&apos;s website to meet certain criteria
            which will help it rank in search engines like Google, Yahoo, and
            Bing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Search engines are tools that let people find information on the
            Internet. They have to decide which websites are the most important
            through factors such as site speed, inbound links and quality
            content.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section className={styles.section}>
          <h2>why is seo important for my business?</h2>
          <p>
            The Internet Age has made the demand for search engine optimization
            experts more acute than ever. In fact, more customers are using
            search engines to find products and services than ever before, which
            makes optimizing your business locally a high priority.
          </p>
          <StatBox
            text=" In 2021 to date, Google accounted for just over 70% of all global
        desktop search traffic, followed by Baidu at 13%, Bing at 12%, and Yahoo
        at 2%. On the first page alone, the first five organic results account
        for 67.60% of all the clicks. These stats reveal that it pays to be
        listed on top!"
          />
          <p>
            SEO is the most cost effective strategy way for businesses to
            acquire new customers.

          <h2>What can Cyber Dojo do for me?</h2>
          <p>
            We are passionate about online marketing and want to help people
            make their websites work for them. We are results driven. Once we
            understand your business goals, we strategize and create a plan that

          <p>
            One thing to note though;{" "}
            <strong>
              WE CANNOT GAURANTEE YOUR BUSINESS WILL BE LISTED ON TOP!
            </strong>{" "}
            Unfortunate, but true. Be skeptical if anyone claims they can offer
            that as a gaurantee. It&apos;s not impossible. It just takes many
            years and constant SEO vigilance battling against competitors and
            search engine algorithms to get to the top.
