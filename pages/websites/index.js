          A website isn&apos;t just an online brochure or a collection of pretty

          <h2>does my business need a website?</h2>
          <p>
            With the explosion of consumer spending habits, small local
            businesses need to update their marketing strategies. A website is
            an indispensable building block of any company&apos;s online
            presence and should be ranked as one of the first goals when
            developing consumer outreach. A local business without a website is
            like a brick-and-mortar store without an address: the shop will be
            there, but unable to take part in most of today&apos;s shopping
            habits and trends.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section className={styles.copy}>
          <h2>what if my business already has a website?</h2>
          <p>
            That&apos;s great! You&apos;ve already taken the first step to
            getting your business in front of more customers. Keep in mind that
            today&apos;s websites have to be updated regularly to ensure search
            engines are indexing new content about your brand and products.
            Also, websites need to be mobile friendly. If your customers find it
            difficult to navigate your website on a mobile device, they may get
            frustrated and leave. It&apos;s always good to have a professional
            audit of your site for any improvements or upgrades.
